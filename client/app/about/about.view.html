		The Cutting Edge project will bring together different sources of information relating to several important 
		archaeological and World Cultures collections. Housed mainly within Newcastle University's Great North Museum, 
		but also including wider collections within Tyne & Wear, our data will relate to tools with sharp edges.

	<p>
		These include stone and metal axes, and knives and weapons of various historical periods, and will be used to create a 
		new online resource that will support teaching and research into the analysis of use-wear patterns on these objects. 
		This innovative project will allow the comprehensive study of 1000 objects, in particular their use-wear patterns, 
		by scholars and members of the public worldwide.
